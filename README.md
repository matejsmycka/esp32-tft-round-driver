# ESP32 TFT display driver

THIS DOES NOT WORK

MANUFACTURER DRIVER INCLUDED. USE IT FOR REFERENCE

PLEASE CONTACT ME IF YOU GET IT WORKING

## Description

I bought a "1.28 inch IPS Color TFT LCD Display Module 1.28" RGB LED Round Touch Screen GC9A01 Drive 4 Wire SPI Interface 240x240 PCB Board" from Aliexpress. It is a 240x240 pixel display with a GC9A01 driver chip. 

I obtained the manufacturer's datasheet and driver code by messaging them on Aliexpress. 
He sent me a shady link with the following files:

- [datasheet](1.28_Inch_IPS_TFT_Round_原理图_88266.pdf)
- [driver code](1.28英寸GC9A01圆形TFT资料_arduino.rar)

I did not get the display working with the provided code or my modifications. I am providing the code and the datasheet for you to look over. However the the esp32 can communicate, but if LCD driver is used, whole code crashes.

## My code

My code is everything else; use it with caution.
